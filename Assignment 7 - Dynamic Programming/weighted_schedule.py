'''
Implement the optimal algorithm for Weighted Interval Scheduling (for a definition of the problem, see
the slides on Canvas) in either C, C++, C#, Java, Python, or Rust. 
Be efficient and implement it in O(n^2) time, where n is the number of jobs.

The objective of the problem is to determine a schedule of non-overlapping intervals with maximum
weight and to return this maximum weight. 
For each instance, your program should output the total weight of the intervals scheduled on a separate line. 

The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. 
For each instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. 
For each job, there will be a trio of positive integers i, j and k, where i < j, and 
i is the start time, j is the end time, and k is the weight.

Notes:
â€¢ Endpoints are exclusive, so it is okay to include a job ending at time t and a job starting at time t
in the same schedule.
